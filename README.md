## Structure

**This' the Frontend repository**: Here, you will find the frontend code for the *FINFO* platform, implemented using React. All the styling is done using Tailwind css.
_**Note**_: This directory only contains the client/frontend part of the project. The *backend* is contained in another repository.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the FINFO platform in fulfilment of the A2SV Generative AI hackathon. By making the repository public, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements as we continue to develop the project ourselves.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

FINFO leverages fine-tuned Generative AI models to power the platform's functionality, particularly powering the request and response feature of the chat application. The chosen Generative AI models, such as the `Llama 2` model, have been fine-tuned to process and interpret user requests/prompts and return relevant (finance) information as per the needs of the user.
